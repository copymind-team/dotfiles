### `dev wt` — Worktree

Must be run from inside a bare-cloned repo. Repo name and paths are detected automatically.

| Command                | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `dev wt env`           | Set up .env.local for current worktree                           |
| `dev wt port`          | Write docker-compose.override.yml from the port registry         |
| `dev wt info`          | Show info about the current worktree                             |

### `dev e` — Env vars

Manages env vars across three places at once: `.env.example` (committed inventory, flat alphabetical), `.env.local` (gitignored cache), and Vercel (canonical store, all entries written as Plain Text/non-sensitive). Must be run from inside a Vercel-linked worktree.

`--prod` targets `production` + `preview` on Vercel. `--dev` targets `development` only. Default (no flag) targets all three plus `.env.local`.

| Command                             | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev e add [--prod\|--dev] NAME`    | Insert into `.env.example`, prompt for value(s), push to selected Vercel envs as non-sensitive, mirror dev to `.env.local` |
| `dev e remove [--prod\|--dev] NAME` | Remove from selected Vercel envs and `.env.local`. Full remove (no flag) also drops the line from `.env.example`           |
| `dev e pull`                        | Replace `.env.local` with the development env from Vercel (flat alphabetical), backfill local-dev defaults, report drift   |
| `dev e push [--force]`              | Bulk-upload `.env.local` to Vercel `development`. Skips existing keys unless `--force`. `VERCEL_*` keys are always skipped |

`add` / `remove` / `pull` / `push` all talk to Vercel via the REST API, not the `vercel env` CLI — see `dev-env.helpers.mjs`. This bypasses Vercel CLI quirks like the un-skippable preview git-branch prompt (vercel/vercel#15763).

### `dev nc` — NanoClaw

| Command       | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev nc up`   | Bootstrap NanoClaw via launchd (kickstarts a stale registration) |
| `dev nc down` | Bootout NanoClaw via launchd                                     |

## Session picker

`prefix + S` opens a popup listing every session with a jump key — digits `1`-`9`
first, then `a`-`z`, so switching is one keystroke:

```
 SESSIONS  12

  1  admin                     1w
▸ 2 *dotfiles                  3w
  3 +graspen-course-ai         2w
  M +monitor                   1w
  ...
  c  zz-other                  1w

  j/k move  h/l column  enter switch  esc cancel
  1-9/a-z/M jump directly   * here   + attached
```

Either press a session's key, or walk the cursor to it with `j`/`k` (or the
arrow keys) and hit `enter`. The cursor's row is highlighted (shown above as
`▸`, which is also drawn, so the cursor survives a terminal with no colors), and
it starts on the session you are already in. `h`/`l` step a whole column, so
they do nothing while the list is one column wide. `esc` cancels; any other key
is ignored rather than closing the popup under you.

`*` marks the session this client is on, `+` one another client is attached to,
and the last column counts windows. Only the client that opened the picker
moves.

Notes:

- Replaces tmux's own `choose-session`, whose labels start at `0` and switch to
  `M-a` from the tenth entry on, and are not configurable.
- Sessions are listed alphabetically, so the keys are stable between openings —
  they only shift when a session is created or destroyed. The cursor follows the
  session it is on, not its index, so a session appearing or going away while the
  popup is open does not move it.
- The [monitor](#session-monitor) is always `M`, wherever it sorts, so the key
  that reaches it from here is the one that opens it from anywhere else
  (`prefix + M`). Lowercase `m` does the same, and is held for it whether or not
  the monitor is running — so the sessions around it keep their keys either way.
  `M` works even when the monitor is one of the entries a short client pushed
  off the end.
- A list too tall for the client flows into up to three columns, filled top to
  bottom, rather than scrolling the first keys off the top. A client too short
  even for that loses the header first, and says `... N more` if entries still
  do not fit.
- `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` are left out of the jump keys because they drive the
  cursor, `x` because it kills, and `m` because the monitor holds it. That is 29
  keys plus the monitor's `M`; sessions past them are listed without one, and
  reachable with the cursor.
- An arrow key is read as the `hjkl` it stands in for, in either encoding a
  terminal may send it (`esc [ A` and `esc O A` both count, and modifiers such as
  ctrl are ignored rather than swallowing the key), so it cannot be mistaken for
  the bare `esc` that cancels. Special keys with nothing bound to them — `home`,
  `page up`, the function keys — are ignored, and do not cancel or switch either.
- Tunables: `PICKER_FILTER` (regex; list only matching sessions),
  `PICKER_WIDTH` (popup width, default 56), `PICKER_COLW` (width of one column
  once there is more than one, default 30), `MONITOR_SESSION` (the session that
  gets `M`, default `monitor` — the same variable the monitor itself reads).

## Session monitor

`prefix + M` opens the `monitor` session: one line per tmux session, showing what
its Claude window is doing right now.

```

  j/k move   enter jump   1-9/a-z jump directly   r refresh   q back
```

Press a session's key to jump to it, or move the cursor with `j`/`k` (or the
arrow keys) and hit `enter`. The cursor's row is highlighted (shown above as `▸`,
which is also drawn, so the cursor survives a terminal with no colors). Only the
client showing the monitor moves, so other attached clients are left where they
are. `q` or `esc` closes the monitor and puts the client back on the session it
came from, rather than dropping it out of tmux — the monitor's session ends on
the way out, and a client attached to a session that gets destroyed would
otherwise detach. If there is nowhere to go back to — attached straight to the
monitor with `tmux attach -t monitor`, or it is the only session left — `q` still
detaches.

`h`, `j`, `k` and `l` are left out of the jump keys because they drive the
cursor — `h`/`l` do nothing here, the list being one column — and so are `q` and
`r`. The cursor stays on its session across refreshes, even as sessions come and
go and the keys shift under it. Arrow keys are read exactly as they are in the
[picker](#session-picker): either encoding, modifiers ignored, and special keys
with nothing bound to them ignored rather than closing the monitor.

| State       | Means                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `working`   | Claude is generating                             |
| `NEEDS YOU` | waiting on a permission, plan or select prompt   |
| `draft`     | text typed into the prompt but not sent          |
| `idle`      | up with an empty prompt; detail is its last task |
| `shell`     | just a shell                                     |
| `other`     | something else running; detail names the command |
| `gone`      | session or pane disappeared                      |

Two columns come from the status line rather than the screen: how much of the
context window that session has used, and what it has cost. Both are blank for a
session that has not answered yet or has no exporter installed — blank means
unknown, which is not the same as zero.

A fourth appears only when it has something to say: the account tag between the
cost and the detail, on screens with more than one account in play — see
[accounts and limits](#accounts-and-limits).

`5a` is the third: how many subagents that session has in flight. Blank at zero,
so it only shows up where something is actually running — see [counting
subagents](#counting-subagents). It is the one number here that says nothing about
the state beside it: a session that has handed five background agents their work
and gone quiet reads `idle 5a`, and that is right. It will answer you now; its
fleet is still busy.

Under the rows is one line per window, each totalling the cost column over a
longer reach than the one above it:

- **`active`** — the sessions on screen, added up. The only row that dies with
  them. It also carries the word `total` for the block; the rows under it are the
  same total over a longer reach, so they do not repeat it.
- **`today`**, **`7d`**, **`30d`**, **`all`** — every session that has run in
  that window, whether or not it is still up. `7d` and `30d` are calendar days
  including today, so `7d` on a Monday reaches back to the previous Tuesday.
  These come from the ledger — see [spend over time](#spend-over-time).

`active` and `today` overlap on purpose: the live sessions are part of the day
they are running in. Each row is then split by how the spend was paid for:

- **`sub ~$487.01`** — what the subscription absorbed, priced at API rates.
  **This is not a bill.** On a subscription nothing is charged for it; the window
  percentages are the real constraint. The tilde is there because it is an
  estimate of a price nobody charged.
- **`api $12.00`** — spend from a session authenticated to an API-billed account
  instead of the subscription. No tilde: that figure is money.
- **`extra ~$4.25`** — spend attributed to a window that was already full. Only
  `active` can show it: it is worked out from the live exports, and the ledger
  records what was spent rather than how.

A column is left blank when nothing landed in it, the same as an empty cost cell
in the rows above — no api spend and no api sessions look alike from here, and
neither is worth a `$0.00`. A row whose spend never got classified still counts
in its total, so a total can exceed `sub` plus `api`.

Sessions are sorted into `sub`/`api` by whether Claude sends them `rate_limits`,
which only goes to a Claude.ai subscription. A personal subscription never
crosses over on its own: hitting the limit stops the session and tells you to run
`/login` for an API-billed account, so anything landing in `api` got there
because someone chose it. A session that has not answered yet counts toward
neither.

### Accounts and limits

Between the header and the rows is one line per account the fleet is signed in
to, carrying that account's own usage windows:

```
  os@pailab.co         11 sess  5h  17% to 5:20PM        7d  28% to Tue 11PM
  work@acme.com         2 sess  5h 100% FULL to 6:02PM   7d  91% to Fri 9AM
```

- **`11 sess`** — how many live sessions are on that account.
- **`5h 17% to 5:20PM`** — the rolling five-hour window and when it clears. This
  is the one that bites when several sessions run at once; it falls on its own as
  older usage rolls out of the window.
- **`7d 28% to Tue 11PM`** — the weekly window. Only really moves one way until
  it resets.
- **`5h 100% FULL`** — the window is exhausted, drawn in red. Anything at or
  above 100 counts: the figure is not clamped there, and readings of `101` have
  turned up in live exports.
- **A line with no numbers** — the account is there and has sessions on it, but
  its only reading has been superseded (see below). Better an empty line than
  last window's figures.

The limit notice read off a session's screen — **`** You're close to your usage
limit`** — stays in the header, since it is one session's report rather than an
account's standing.

The rows then carry a short tag saying which account each session's figures came
from: the part of the address in front of the `@`, or the front of the whole
address where two accounts share one. **The column only appears when there is more than one account
to tell apart** — on the ordinary single-account screen every row would say the
same word, so the detail keeps the space instead.

Two things are deliberately kept off the account lines:

- **API-billed sessions** are tagged `api` and get no line. They have no rate
  limits at all, and putting them under whichever address the config holds would
  count a session against a subscription it is not spending from.
- **Sessions that have not said** — no exporter, or no answer yet — are tagged
  blank. If *nothing* on screen names an account, the monitor falls back to the
  single `5h`/`7d` pair in the header that it showed before any of this existed.

#### What the label actually means

**The account signed in when those numbers came back.** Not which account the
session will use next — that distinction is the whole design, and getting it
wrong is visible.

Claude does not tell a status line who is signed in. The payload's keys are
`context_window`, `cost`, `cwd`, `effort`, `exceeds_200k_tokens`, `fast_mode`,
`model`, `output_style`, `prompt_id`, `rate_limits`, `session_id`,
`session_name`, `thinking`, `transcript_path`, `version`, `vim` and `workspace` —
checked against a real one, not the docs. The account is not in the transcript or
in Claude's session registry either. The only place it is written down is
Claude's own config, and with a single config dir that is **one global file**
that `/login` rewrites for every session on the machine at once.

So reading it at render time is wrong, and wrong in the way that looks right:
sessions re-render for all sorts of reasons, and each one that did would pick up
the account you had just switched to while still reporting the *previous*
account's usage windows underneath it. One `/login` and the whole fleet relabels
itself to an account most of it never used.

`claude/statusline.sh` therefore only consults the config when the session has
actually heard from the API since its last export — the limits, their reset times
and the cost all arrive in the same response, so if none of them has moved there
is no new reading to label and the previous label still describes the numbers
being re-exported. A session that has answered since a switch relabels itself; one
that has not keeps the account its figures belong to.

Two consequences worth expecting:

- **A line can name an account you have already left.** That is correct: those
  numbers are that account's. It clears itself the moment the session answers.
- **After a switch, nothing says which account an idle session will bill next.**
  Globally it is the new one for everybody, and nothing observable from outside
  the process distinguishes a session that has picked up new credentials from one
  that has not. The monitor does not guess.

Within an account the newest reading still wins, and a reading whose reset time
has already passed is dropped rather than aged into second place — a session
sitting idle across a rollover keeps re-exporting the old window's usage with a
fresh timestamp on it.

The address is read through a one-line cache in `~/.claude/monitor/accounts`,
keyed off the config's own mtime, so the 120KB config is parsed on a login and a
switch and almost never otherwise.

#### Running two accounts at once

`/login` switching gives you one account at a time. To keep two signed in
simultaneously, give each its own config directory — it carries the whole account
store, logins included:

```sh
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work claude    # /login once, then it stays
```

The monitor needs nothing configured for this: sessions started that way export
their own address and pick up their own line.

### Spend over time

The `active` row only knows about sessions that are still up, because it adds up
the cost column and that comes from the per-pane exports, which the next session
in that pane overwrites. So `claude/statusline.sh` also keeps a ledger, in
`~/.claude/monitor/spend`: one small file per session per day, named
`<day>.<session id>`, holding the cents that session spent on that day and
whether it was paying by subscription or by API key, and which account it was on
at the time.

Each write compares the session's cumulative cost against what the file last
saw and adds the difference. On the first write of a new day the figure to
measure against is carried over from the day that session wrote before, or a
session left running past midnight would drop its whole history onto the new day.
A `/clear` or a resume taking the cost backwards rebases instead of accruing a
negative.

The monitor sums today's files on every tick and the older ones once a day —
days before today cannot change — so the four rows cost a handful of file reads
and no forks.

Worth knowing:

- **It starts when it is installed.** There is no history before the first write;
  the numbers are only complete from that day forward.
- **It counts sessions outside tmux too.** The ledger is keyed by session id
  rather than by pane, so anything running `claude` on this machine lands in it.
  That also means it is this machine only.
- **`today` overlaps `active`.** The live sessions are part of the day they are
  running in, and are counted in both rows.
- **A session already running when it was installed** had no earlier file to
  carry from, so its history up to that point landed on that first day. Once,
  at install, and only for what was already up.
- **Nothing is ever pruned.** A few dozen files a day is nothing until it is;
  `rm ~/.claude/monitor/spend/2025-*` is the whole cleanup story, at the cost of
  those days leaving `all`.

### Extra usage

The `extra` column is inferred, from two independent sides:

- **Arithmetic**, in `claude/statusline.sh`: each run compares the session's cost
  against its own last export and files the difference under whether a window
  read full when it was earned. Handles a window resetting mid-session, and a
  `/clear` taking the cost back to zero.
- **The screen**, in `monitor_scan_notice()`: the notices Claude renders near the
  overage cap or after a refusal — "close to your usage limit", "out of extra
  usage", "hit your monthly spend limit" — matched as whole phrases, and only in
  the bottom few rows, since the transcript above is full of sentences that would
  otherwise match.

One caveat once extra usage is switched on. The API can report the weekly window
as `seven_day_overage_included`, with the overage headroom folded into the
denominator — in which case it may never read 100 while overage is being spent,
and the arithmetic under-counts. Treat `extra` as a floor, and
`CLAUDE_OVERAGE_AT` (default 100) as the knob if the percentage behaves
differently.

### Counting subagents

`5a` in a row is how many subagents that session has in flight.

There is nothing on the screen to count: Claude's fleet view lists agents only
while it is open, and it is not on screen at all in a session nobody is looking at.
Claude's own events do carry it. `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` each name the
agent they are about, and `Stop` and `SubagentStop` both carry the whole
background-task registry.

So `claude/monitor-hook.sh` keeps a directory per pane,
`~/.claude/monitor/<server pid>-<pane>.agents`, holding one empty file named for
each agent in flight. The count is however many files are in it, which costs the
monitor a glob and no forks at all. Files rather than a number in a file because
five agents spawned in one turn is five copies of the hook running at once, and a
number would need a read, an add and a write between them.

The registry is what keeps it honest, at two points:

- **Every `Stop`** reconciles the directory against it in both directions. `Stop`
  fires once the main loop has finished, so nothing foreground can still be up: a
  marker with nothing behind it is a leftover — an agent killed before its stop
  event, or a session already running a fleet when the hooks were installed — and
  can go.
- **Every `SubagentStop`** adopts anything the registry names that has no marker,
  and drops nothing but the agent that just stopped. Additive only, because that
  snapshot excludes foreground agents and removing on it would take out every
  foreground agent running in parallel. This is what stops a catch-up from waiting
  out a turn — under a fleet, a session can stay busy for an hour.

Unlike the exported state, the count is never aged out. A session that hands five
background agents their work and goes quiet stops writing state long before they
finish, and expiring the count would blank it on exactly the sessions it exists
for. What guards it instead is the pane: a pane with no Claude in it counts
nothing, whatever is left in its directory, so a fleet whose session was killed
outright stops being reported rather than sitting there forever.

Worth knowing:

- **A stopped clock in the fleet view is not a finished agent.** It is idle between
  turns and can be woken with a queued message, which restarts its clock. Claude's
  registry still counts it, so this does too — the count and the fleet list agree.
- **It needs the hooks.** A session running on a machine without them counts
  nothing. A session that was already up when they were merged in does pick them
  up — Claude Code re-reads `settings.json` — but a fleet it launched before that
  is only counted once its next turn ends and the reconcile finds it.
- **A fleet under a parked job is counted too**, by the same markers, filed under
  the background session instead of the pane — [parked jobs](#parked-jobs).
- **Subagents only.** Background shells, MCP tasks and monitors sit in the same
  registry and are deliberately left out; Claude's own footer already counts those
  ("6 shells, 2 monitors").
- **A nested agent** — one an agent spawned itself — is counted while it runs, but
  a reconcile may lose sight of it if the registry does not carry nested tasks, in
  which case the count runs short until that agent stops.

Which pane each session is judged by, in order: one actually running Claude, else
one in a window named `claude`, else the session's active pane. If the Claude in
that pane has parked its work on a background session, the row follows it — see
[parked jobs](#parked-jobs). Claude Code
reports its version as its process name (`2.1.223`), which is how it is
recognised — so a window auto-renamed away from `claude` is still found, and so
is Claude sitting in the half of a split that is not focused.

### Parked jobs

What is in a pane is not always what is doing the work. Handed something long,
Claude parks it: a background session starts under its daemon and the pane shows
that session instead. The daemon does not pass `$TMUX_PANE` on, so the session
actually working — spending the money, running the agents — has no pane to be
keyed by, and until this it exported nothing at all. The row then showed the
*other* session's last numbers, frozen at the moment it parked, which is not stale
by a little: it is the wrong session. One here read `8% $1.44` while its own status
line said `ctx 14% · $70.46`.

Claude keeps a registry that closes the gap, one small JSON file per running
session in `~/.claude/sessions`. The session in the pane carries a `parkedJobId`,
and the session doing the work carries the matching `jobId` beside its own session
id — which is the key its exports are filed under:

```
pane %92 → its session id → parkedJobId → jobId → sess-<id>.state / .meta / .agents
```

So both exporters now fall back to keying by session id when there is no pane, and
the monitor reads the registry once a tick into two flat indexes (bash 3.2 here has
no associative arrays) and follows that chain per pane. State, context, cost and
the agent count all come from whichever session the pane is really showing. A few
dozen one-line files read by bash itself, so it costs no forks.

Worth knowing:

- **The link needs the pane's own export to exist**, since that is where the
  session id comes from. The hook writes one from a session's first event, so this
  is only ever missing where the exporters are not installed.
- **A job that has exported nothing is not followed.** It has finished, or it runs
  where the exporters do not — and the pane's own numbers, old as they are, are
  then the best there is.
- **`active` totals the parked session, not the pane's.** One row, one session; the
  pane session's own spend is still in the ledger, so no day loses it.
- **A background session that never gets `SessionEnd`** leaves its `sess-*` files
  behind. They are a few hundred bytes and nothing reads them once the registry
  stops naming them; `rm ~/.claude/monitor/sess-*` while nothing is parked is the
  whole cleanup story.

### How the state is worked out

Two sources, because neither sees everything.

**The screen**, via `capture-pane`. What matters is not the wording but *where
Claude parked the cursor*, which says which widget has the keyboard: the input
box holds it after the prompt glyph, and a dialog moves it onto the selected row.
Wording alone will not separate them — "Do you want …" appears in Claude's own
replies and in the transcript of prompts already answered. The separator after
the glyph does: the input box uses a non-breaking space, every dialog a plain
one. Position does not, because the dialog `AskUserQuestion` puts up is not
indented and its selected row sits at column 0 looking exactly like an input box.

Text on the prompt row is not proof anyone typed it, either: Claude fills an
empty box with a dim suggestion of what to ask next. The cursor settles that too
— typing moves it past the glyph — and only in the ambiguous case is one extra
`capture-pane -pe` spent to check whether that text is dim.

**Claude's own events**, via `claude/monitor-hook.sh`, which every hook runs and
which leaves a state file per pane in `~/.claude/monitor`, plus the count of
subagents that pane has running — [counting subagents](#counting-subagents).
`claude/statusline.sh` adds context, cost, the usage windows and the account they
were read under to the same place, since none of it is on the screen at all — and
the account is not even in the payload Claude pipes it, so that one comes out of
Claude's own config. Both key their files by tmux server pid and pane id, which
is what `$TMUX_PANE` in their environment makes possible — or by session id where
there is no pane, which is how a [parked job](#parked-jobs) is found.

Neither source overrules the other:

- `NEEDS YOU` — whichever notices first. Usually the screen: `Notification` lags
  the prompt by about six seconds, a refresh tick is two.
- `draft` — the screen only. No event fires for typing.
- `working` / `idle` — the events, when fresh. They know a turn has started
  before any of it reaches the screen.
- `shell` / `other` / `gone` — the screen, and final.

A session with no exporter installed — another machine, or one started before it
was — loses the context and cost columns, contributes no account line, and
nothing else. An exported state
older than `MONITOR_STALE` is ignored, so a Claude killed before `SessionEnd`
cannot leave a row stuck on `working`.

Notes:

- Everything is read by polling, so the monitor never attaches a client to the
  monitored sessions and cannot resize or disturb them.
- One `list-panes` covers every session. A tick over fifteen sessions costs
  ~100ms, and every session is sampled at the same instant.
- Claude Code UI strings live in `monitor_classify()` and `monitor_busy_titles()`
  in `tmux/monitor.sh` — the places to fix if a release reworks the footer or the
  title.
- Tunables: `MONITOR_INTERVAL` (seconds, default 2), `MONITOR_WINDOW` (preferred
  window name, default `claude`), `MONITOR_FILTER` (regex; list only matching
  sessions, e.g. `^graspen-`), `MONITOR_SESSION` (default `monitor`),
  `CLAUDE_MONITOR_DIR` (default `~/.claude/monitor`), `CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR`
  (Claude's own session registry, read to follow parked jobs, default
  `~/.claude/sessions`), `MONITOR_STALE` (seconds an exported state stays trusted,
  default 90), `CLAUDE_OVERAGE_AT` (window percentage counted as exhausted,
  default 100).
- `prefix + M` replaces tmux's default "clear marked pane"; `prefix + m` still
  toggles a mark.

## Session restore

`tmux-resurrect` saves the layout and `tmux-continuum` replays it, every 5
minutes and again on the next tmux server start. Out of the box that brings back
the windows, the panes and each pane's directory — but not what was running in
them. `nvim` is on resurrect's default process list; `claude` is not, so a claude
window came back as a bare shell.

Three scripts close that gap. Two hang off resurrect's own hooks, one off
Claude's:

| Script                    | Runs                                                 | Does                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `tmux/claude-save.sh`     | `@resurrect-hook-post-save-all`, i.e. on every save  | Writes `~/.claude/resurrect-map`                    |
| `tmux/claude-restore.sh`  | `@resurrect-processes`, in each restored claude pane | `exec claude --resume <the session that was there>` |
| `tmux/claude-snapshot.sh` | Claude's `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` hooks       | Takes a resurrect save when the state changes       |

Claude already knows which conversation is in which pane —
`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` carries the session id, the cwd and the tmux
pane. What it does not do is outlive the process, so after a reboot there is
nothing left to read. `claude-save.sh` copies those fields into one
tab-separated file, keyed by `<session>:<window>.<pane>` — the coordinates
resurrect rebuilds from its own save — with the tmux socket alongside, since
coordinates repeat between servers and only the socket tells them apart:

```
graspen-pipeline:1.1	/Users/you/loop.git/graspen-pipeline	0101c585-…	/private/tmp/tmux-501/default
article:1.1	        /Users/you/copymind-app/article	        da7d9d42-…	/private/tmp/tmux-501/default
article:1.2	        /Users/you/copymind-app/article	        9e49e366-…	/private/tmp/tmux-501/default
```

Two conversations in one directory get one line each, which is the case
`claude --continue` cannot express — it can only ever hand back the newest. A
session whose process is no longer running gets no line at all: a claude that was
killed rather than asked to leave can leave its registry file behind, naming a
pane that has since moved on.

On the way back, `claude-restore.sh` asks tmux where it is, looks up that line,
moves to the directory the line records, and resumes. What it does when the
lookup misses:

| Situation                                          | Result                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A line for these coordinates, on this server       | `claude --resume <id>` |
| No line for this pane, nothing else claims the cwd, and the cwd has a conversation | `claude --continue` |
| No line, but another pane claims the cwd           | `claude` (fresh)       |
| Map missing, transcript deleted, id malformed, line from another tmux server | `claude` (fresh) |

`--continue` is the fallback because a claude started since the last save is
invisible to the map, and its conversation is almost always the newest one in
the directory. It is skipped when another pane claims the same directory — both
panes would resume the same conversation and show it to you twice, with the
second pane's edits landing somewhere you are not looking — and when the
directory has no conversation at all, where `--continue` does not start fresh but
fails, taking the shell it was exec'd over with it.

### The directory comes from the map, not the pane

resurrect recreates a pane in whatever path its own save recorded, and that path
is a guess: it is read off the pane's process, it falls back to the home
directory when the directory has since been deleted, and once wrong it stays
wrong, because the next save records the wrong answer again. A pane that came
back in the wrong place used to take its claude with it — and with no line
matching that directory, it would `--continue` whatever conversation was newest
there, which in `$HOME` belongs to no project at all.

So the cwd in the map is not a check, it is the answer: it is where claude itself
said it was running, and `claude-restore.sh` moves there before exec'ing. If that
directory is gone, the pane stays where resurrect put it, which is at least
somewhere that exists.

### A session you quit stays quit

What a pane comes back as is decided entirely by the last snapshot, so anything
that happens between two saves is invisible — which showed up as two complaints
that look unrelated and are the same bug. A session started since the last save
was not in it, so its pane came back as a bare shell. A session quit with `/exit`
was still in it, so a pane closed on purpose reopened on the next boot, resuming
a conversation you were finished with.

`claude-snapshot.sh` saves when the state changes instead of when the clock says
so. On `SessionStart`, straight away. On `SessionEnd`, only once the process is
actually gone — the hook fires while claude is still up, and a save taken then
would record the very thing it is meant to forget.

Only a deliberate exit counts, and the reason says which is which:

| Reason              | Means                          | Snapshot |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `prompt_input_exit` | `/exit`, or `^D`               | yes      |
| `logout`            | `/logout`                      | yes      |
| `clear`             | `/clear` — the pane still has claude in it | no |
| `other`             | signalled, e.g. by a reboot    | no       |

That last row is the one that matters: a machine going down signals claude like
anything else, and treating that as "you are done here" would save a screenful of
empty shells over the layout at the one moment it is most worth keeping.

Notes:

- The map is written from the post-save hook, not on a timer, so it and the
  layout beside it describe the same instant.
- Snapshots are debounced to one per 30 seconds, so a fleet coming up at once
  saves once rather than a dozen times.
- Nothing snapshots during a restore, or for two minutes after one. A restore
  brings panes up one at a time and sends each its command with `send-keys`, so
  for a while the layout is real but half of it is still a shell waiting for
  claude to appear; a save taken then restores nothing next time. resurrect's
  `pre-restore-all` and `post-restore-all` hooks are what mark the window.
- `claude-restore.sh` ends in `exec`, always. resurrect works out what a pane was
  running by asking `ps` for the shell's child, so a wrapper left sitting in
  between would be recorded instead of `claude`, stop matching, and the pane
  would restore exactly once.
- Matched as `~claude`, so `claude`, `claude -r` and `claude --resume <id>` all
  come back through the wrapper. The saved arguments are dropped — the map is a
  better answer than a stale command line.
- Restoring a full fleet starts every one of those claude processes at once.
  Nothing is sent to the API until you type, but the transcripts are read from
  disk.
- Tunables: `CLAUDE_RESURRECT_MAP` (default `~/.claude/resurrect-map`),
  `CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR` (default `~/.claude/sessions`), `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR`
  (default `~/.claude/projects`), `CLAUDE_SNAPSHOT_DEBOUNCE` (30s),
  `CLAUDE_SNAPSHOT_COOLDOWN` (120s), `CLAUDE_SNAPSHOT_WAIT` (30s).
- To turn it off, drop `@resurrect-processes` from `.tmux.conf`; panes still come
  back in the right directory, just without claude in them.

## Claude Code config

`claude/` holds the Claude Code setup: settings, the two exporter scripts the
[session monitor](#session-monitor) reads, and user-level `skills/`. The scripts
and each skill are symlinked. Settings are **merged**, because Claude writes to
that file itself — `/model`, permission changes, enabled plugins — and a symlink
would drag every runtime toggle into git as a dirty working tree.

`claude/settings.json` holds **exactly two keys**: `statusLine` and `hooks`.
Those are what the session monitor reads, so they are the only things worth
sharing. Everything else in a Claude settings file belongs to whoever owns the
laptop and is never tracked:

| Shared, installed for everyone | Yours alone, never touched |
| --- | --- |
| `statusLine` | `editorMode`, `tui`, `model`, `enabledPlugins`, `extraKnownMarketplaces`, notifications |
| `hooks` | `env` and its tokens |
| | `permissions` — including `defaultMode` and the `skip*` prompts, which decide how much Claude does without asking |

The merge only touches the keys it is given, so `./install.sh` on a colleague's
machine gives them the monitor integration and changes nothing else. Their editor
mode, model and permission posture survive every `git pull && ./install.sh`.

The merge is `claude/merge-settings.sh`, runnable and testable on its own:

```bash
claude/merge-settings.sh <live.json> <shared.json>   # merged JSON on stdout
```

It refuses rather than damages — exit 1 on unreadable or invalid JSON, exit 2 if
the shared file has grown an `env` block — and `install.sh` writes through a temp
file, so a failure leaves the existing settings untouched.

The two shared keys are applied differently:

- **`statusLine` is replaced** — there is only one of it. If you already had a
  custom one, the install says so and leaves the previous file at
  `~/.claude/settings.json.bak`.
- **`hooks` are appended per event**, so a colleague's own `PostToolUse`
  formatter keeps running alongside ours. Entries pointing at our script are
  removed first, so re-running never stacks duplicates.

Paths inside are written as `~/.claude/…` rather than absolute, so the file is
portable between machines and between users. Both the status line and hooks run
their command through a shell, so the `~` expands.

`tests/unit/04-claude-settings-merge.test.sh` covers the merge. Its main
assertion is a property rather than a checklist: for every scalar leaf in the
original config, outside the two keys we own, the merged result must hold the
same value at the same path — which covers settings this repo has never heard of.
It runs over a config containing something of everything, over the empty and
near-empty cases, over this machine's real config if there is one, and three
times in a row to prove the result converges. The detector itself is tested
first, against a deliberately lossy pair, because "reports nothing lost" and
"is broken" look identical from the outside.

`tests/unit/03-no-secrets.test.sh` is the other backstop. It scans tracked and
new-but-unignored files for credential-shaped tokens and for secret-named JSON
keys with values, and it asserts the shared settings file contains nothing but
`statusLine` and `hooks` — an allowlist, so widening what this repo pushes onto
other laptops takes a deliberate edit to the test as well. The untracked half of
the scan matters most: a secret is at its most dangerous in the moment before it
is first committed.

## Testing

```bash
./test.sh                    # all tests
./test.sh --unit             # unit only (no Docker/Supabase needed)
./test.sh --integration      # integration only
./test.sh --e2e              # e2e only
./test.sh link               # pattern filter
```

Requires everything `install.sh` sets up (`supabase`, `jq`, `pgflow`, `node`, …) plus `psql`, `rsync`, `curl`, `docker`. Run `./install.sh` before the first test run.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/copymind-ai/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The install script will install all tools from the table above and symlink configs to their expected locations. Existing config files are backed up with a `.bak` suffix before symlinking.

## Adding a new config

1. Move the config file/folder into the dotfiles repo, mirroring the home directory structure
2. Add a `link` entry in `install.sh`
3. Run `./test.sh --unit` — it will refuse anything carrying a credential
4. Commit and push

Use `link` for step 2: it backs up whatever is already at the destination, and
replaces an existing directory rather than creating the symlink inside it.

## Keeping in sync

```bash
git pull && ./install.sh
```
