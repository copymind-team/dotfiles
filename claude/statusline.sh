# Claude pipes the session as JSON on stdin and renders whatever we print, in a
# row of its own between the input box and the mode footer.
#
# The export half is the point. None of these numbers are on the screen for the
# monitor to read, and $TMUX_PANE is in our environment, so we can leave them in
# a file keyed by the very pane the monitor already indexes by. Exporting beats
# parsing the rendered line: the status bar truncates at narrow widths, and
# system notices share the row and can cut it short.
#
# There are two files, and they answer different questions. The per-pane export
# says what is true of the session in that pane right now, and dies with it. The
# spend ledger says what has been spent, day by day, and outlives every session
# in it -- which is the only way the monitor can total a day, a week or a month
# rather than whatever happens to still be running.
#
# Two things this deliberately does not report: whether Claude is working, and
# whether it is waiting on a prompt. There is no field for the first, and the
# status line is not rendered at all while a permission dialog is up -- verified,

# --- which account this reading was taken under -------------------------------
#
# Not in the payload. Claude pipes the model, the cost, the context, the limits
# and the session id, and says nothing at all about who is signed in -- confirmed
# against a real payload, whose keys are exactly context_window, cost, cwd,
# effort, exceeds_200k_tokens, fast_mode, model, output_style, prompt_id,
# rate_limits, session_id, session_name, thinking, transcript_path, version, vim
# and workspace. Nor is it in the transcript or in Claude's session registry. The
# only place it is written down is Claude's own config.
#
# Which is a single global file, and that is the whole difficulty. `/login`
# rewrites it in place for every session on the machine at once, so reading it on
# every render attributes the account you just switched to to sessions that never
# switched -- they re-render for all sorts of reasons, pick up the new address,
# and go on reporting the previous account's usage windows underneath it. That is
# not a smaller version of the right answer; it is the wrong session's label on a
# real number.
#
# So the config is only consulted when this session has actually heard from the
# API since the last export. The limits, their reset times and the cost all come
# from the same response, so if none of them has moved there is no new reading to
# label and the previous label still describes the numbers being re-exported. The
# stamp therefore means one precise thing: the account that was signed in when
# these numbers came back. A session that has answered since a switch relabels
# itself; one that has not keeps the account its figures actually belong to.
#
# What it deliberately does not claim is which account a session will use next.
# After a global switch that is the new one for everybody, whatever their last
# reading says -- and nothing observable from out here distinguishes a session
# that has quietly picked up new credentials from one that has not.
#
# The session id is checked alongside the numbers because a pane outlives the
# session in it: the export is keyed by tmux server pid and pane, so the first
# render of a new session in a reused pane compares itself against the previous
# occupant's reading. That normally reads as a change anyway -- a new session
# starts at no cost -- but only by coincidence, and a label inherited from a
# session that has ended belongs to nothing on the screen. The id is what makes
# it a different reading by construction.
