#
#   1. Homebrew install (first run only). The Homebrew installer creates
#      /opt/homebrew (Apple Silicon) or /usr/local (Intel) owned by the
#      current user, and triggers `xcode-select --install` — both require
#      sudo. On re-runs, brew is already present and this step is skipped.
#
#   2. Appending `127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal` to /etc/hosts. /etc/hosts
#      is root-owned (mode 644), so `tee -a` must run under sudo. Skipped
#      if the entry is already present.
#
# `brew install <pkg>`, npm global installs into the Homebrew prefix,
# Oh My Zsh, TPM, and symlinks under $HOME all run as the user — no sudo.

# /model, permission changes and enabled plugins all land there -- so a symlink
# would either be replaced behind your back or drag every runtime toggle into git
# as a dirty working tree.
#
# Exactly two things are shared -- the status line and the hooks -- because those
# are what the tmux monitor reads. Everything else in that file belongs to
# whoever owns the laptop: editor mode, model, plugins, notifications, the env
# block with its tokens, and above all the permission posture (defaultMode and
# the skip* prompts, which decide how much Claude does without asking). None of
# it is tracked, and the merge below cannot touch a key it does not mention.
#
# statusLine is replaced outright; there is only one of it. Hooks are appended
# per event instead, because a colleague may well have their own PostToolUse
# formatter and a plain merge would drop it -- the arrays live under the same key.
