# Two steps in this script need root:
#
#   1. Homebrew install (first run only). The Homebrew installer creates
#      /opt/homebrew (Apple Silicon) or /usr/local (Intel) owned by the
#      current user, and triggers `xcode-select --install` — both require
#      sudo. On re-runs, brew is already present and this step is skipped.
#
#   2. Appending `127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal` to /etc/hosts. /etc/hosts
#      is root-owned (mode 644), so `tee -a` must run under sudo. Skipped
#      if the entry is already present.
#
# `brew install <pkg>`, npm global installs into the Homebrew prefix,
# Oh My Zsh, TPM, and symlinks under $HOME all run as the user — no sudo.
#
# We prompt for the password upfront so the rest of the run is unattended,
# and keep the timestamp alive in the background until this script exits.
