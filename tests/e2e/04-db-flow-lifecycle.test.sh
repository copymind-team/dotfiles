# Entry state (left by 03-db-reset):
#   - Supabase running with edge_runtime enabled
#   - feat-gamma worktree exists
#   - shared supabase worktree has supabase/flows/noop.ts (git-tracked from fixture)
#
# This file tests the released-flow guard — the pre-pass validation that
# prevents rewriting a flow's migration once it's on origin/main.
#
# The scenario deliberately boots the stack from a feature worktree before
# invoking `dev sb flow`. That's a hostile starting state, not a behaviour
# we promise to heal: we only assert the guard still fires correctly in
# spite of it. Anchor drift shouldn't happen in practice — every `dev sb`
# lifecycle command `cd`s into the shared supabase worktree before calling
# `supabase start`, so the edge runtime is always anchored there unless a
# user runs raw `supabase ...` from a feature worktree.
#
# End-to-end `npx pgflow compile` is NOT tested here: Deno inside the
# edge-runtime container can't reliably resolve jsr.io / registry.npmjs.org
# under Docker Desktop on macOS without a pre-warmed cache. The compile
# path is covered by pgflow's own test suite; this file focuses on the
# orchestration that surrounds it — rsync, restart, and pre-pass guards.
