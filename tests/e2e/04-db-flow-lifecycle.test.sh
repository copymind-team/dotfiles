# Entry state (left by 03-db-reset):
#   - Supabase running with edge_runtime enabled
#   - feat-gamma worktree exists
#   - shared supabase worktree has supabase/flows/noop.ts (git-tracked from fixture)
#
# This file tests the released-flow guard — the pre-pass validation that
# prevents rewriting a flow's migration once it's on origin/main.
#
# The scenario deliberately boots the stack from a feature worktree before
# invoking `dev sb flow`. That's a hostile starting state, not a behaviour
# we promise to heal: we only assert the guard still fires correctly in
# spite of it. Anchor drift shouldn't happen in practice — every `dev sb`
# lifecycle command `cd`s into the shared supabase worktree before calling
# `supabase start`, so the edge runtime is always anchored there unless a
# user runs raw `supabase ...` from a feature worktree.
#
# End-to-end **worker boot** (Deno resolving jsr.io/npm from inside the
# edge-runtime container) is NOT tested here: Docker Desktop on macOS
# can't reliably resolve those registries without a pre-warmed cache.
# That path is covered by pgflow's own test suite.
#
# We DO exercise real `npx pgflow compile` on the success path below —
# compile runs on the host, not inside Docker, so the macOS Desktop DNS
# quirk doesn't apply. The assertions only check artifacts on disk, not
# whether the worker successfully boots and polls.
