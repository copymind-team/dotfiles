# --- exported state ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# What claude/monitor-hook.sh and claude/statusline.sh leave behind, one pair of
# files per pane. Reading them costs no forks at all -- they are a handful of
# key=value lines each and bash reads them itself -- so this is nearly free next
# to the capture-pane the screen needs anyway.
#
# Everything here is advisory. A session on another machine, one started before
# the hooks were installed, or one whose Claude was killed before SessionEnd will
# have no file or a stale one, and the monitor falls back to what it can see.

X_AGENTS=()   # per session: subagents in flight; see monitor_count_agents
# A row's number and nothing more. The fleet-wide total used to ride in the
# header next to the cents its finished agents had accounted for, and neither
# said anything worth the width: the count is a sum over a column already on
# screen, and the spend was a breakout of a cost the rows were already showing.
# Spend is split by how the session is paying, because on a subscription the two
# mean completely different things. A subscription session's cost is notional --
# what those tokens would have cost at API rates -- and nothing is billed for it;
# the limits are the real constraint. An API-billed session's cost is money. A
# personal subscription never silently crosses over: hitting the limit stops the
# session and tells you to run /login for an API-billed account, so anything in
# the API column got there because someone chose it.
X_COST_SUB=""
X_COST_API=""
X_COST_OVER=""   # spend the exporter attributed to an exhausted window
X_NOTICE=""      # a limit notice read off some session's screen

# --- accounts -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The limits used to be treated as one pair for the whole screen, on the grounds
# that they are account-wide and every session therefore reports the same two
# numbers. That holds for exactly as long as there is one account.
#
# With more than one it is wrong in a way that is worse than useless, because the
# numbers still look right. Whichever session answered last wins the header, so a
# fleet split across two subscriptions shows one of them and calls it the total --
# and it changes which one behind your back, every time the other side answers.
# The same thing happens on a single config dir: /login rewrites it in place, and
# for a while afterwards half the fleet is still reporting the account you just
# left. That is the case worth catching, since nothing on the screen would
# otherwise say the reading had gone stale.
#
# So the readings are grouped by the account they were taken under, and each
# account gets its own line. Parallel arrays rather than a structure: bash 3.2 has
# no associative arrays, and there are only ever a handful of these.
#
# The key is the account's email address, except for two cases that have to be
# kept out of the subscription lines. An API-billed session is keyed "api": it has
# no rate limits at all, and grouping it under whichever address the config
# happens to hold would put a session that is not on the subscription onto the
# subscription's line. A session that has not said -- no exporter, or no answer
# yet -- is keyed empty, and its readings go to the X_LIM5/X_LIM7 fallback so an
# older setup keeps the header it had before this existed.
ACC_KEY=()    # the account, as the status line exported it
ACC_N=()      # live sessions signed in to it
ACC_LIM5=(); ACC_LIM7=()

ACC_TS=()     # write time of the reading held above, so the newest one wins
ACC_TAG=()    # short label for the session rows; see monitor_acc_tags
ACC_SHOWN=0   # accounts with a line of their own, i.e. not "api" and not unknown

# The notices Claude Code puts up about limits and extra usage. These are matched
# rather than any field, because the field does not exist anywhere reachable:
# isUsingOverage lives only inside the process, and its own renderer returns
# nothing at all for the ordinary in-overage case -- a message appears only near
# the overage cap or once something has been refused. So this catches the loud
# half, and the exporter's arithmetic covers the quiet half.
#
# Matched as whole phrases, since the bottom of the screen also holds Claude's
# own prose and "you've reached your" is a sentence anyone might write.

# --- parked jobs --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# What is in a pane is not always what is doing the work. Handed something long,
# Claude parks it: a background session is started under its daemon and the pane
# shows that session instead. The daemon does not pass $TMUX_PANE on, so the
# session actually working -- spending the money, running the agents -- has no
# pane to be keyed by, and the pane's own export freezes at the moment it parked.
# A row showing that export is not stale by a little: it is the wrong session.
#
# Claude keeps a registry that closes the gap, one small JSON file per running
# session in $SESSION_DIR. The session in the pane carries a parkedJobId, and the
# session doing the work carries the matching jobId along with its own session id
# -- which is the key its exports are filed under. So: pane -> its session id ->
# parkedJobId -> jobId -> the background session's export.
#
# The whole registry is read once a tick into two flat indexes, since bash 3.2 on
# this laptop has no associative arrays. A few dozen one-line files read by bash
# itself, so this costs no forks either.
